This is the vision.

Free, open-source input mapping software for the xbox 360 controller with which any user of Microsoft Windows can use
to play video games, or use their controller as a mouse.

It will support the mapping of keys to controller buttons, triggers, and thumbsticks as well as mouse movement to a
thumbstick.
